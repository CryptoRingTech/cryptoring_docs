![CryptoRing Architecture](/CryptoRingPlatform.svg)

The main goal of the CryptoRing Platform is to make crypto trading bots and applications developers' life easier. To accomplish it, we collect various data from different sources and push it into unified **data streams**.

Eg. best bid and ask prices from Poloniex, Binance, etc; trades from different CEXs and DEXs; social media and news posts and others.

To make developers' life even easier, we have a set of unified **trading APIs** to manage different exchanges, either centralized or decentralized.

Special **adaptor** collects data from exchanges, blockchains, social and news feeds. It provides an interface for API as well.

Bot or another app can connect to the Platform through different **connectors**. A developer can choose a connector that satisfies the app's needs. Most of the connectors have the same functionality. We are going to implement connectors for WebSocket, APQP (RabbitMQ), MQTT, GraphQL, Fix and maybe some others if developers ask for them.

For the most commonly used programming languages, we have **binding libraries** on our [GitHub](https://github.com/CryptoRingTech).

We'll discuss all the stuff in more detail in the following parts.
