**Connectors** are interfaces between your trading bot or other app and the Platform. For your convenience, we have several connectors. You can use any of them or several at once, depending on your app's needs.

Use a *user key* and an *application key* to authenticate with any connector.

All connectors use encrypted  (SSL/TLS) connections.

No matter which connector you use, you pay for each connection of your app to the Platform. The first two connections are free.
